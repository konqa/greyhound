      <p>
        Greyhound makes every effort to keep to schedule. We really do. However,
        sometimes our service is disrupted and the schedule changes because of
        uncontrollable circumstances such as road conditions, unexpectedly high
        passenger loads or weather. For these rare occasions when we are late,
        we cannot say sorry enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anything left on a bus and then found by one of our brilliant and loyal
        staff will be handed over to the bus driver. If so, it will safely end
        up at our Customer Care Office the next day. Please call us the next
        day, after midday, to check if your item was handed in. You can get hold
        of this office on +2634 732 080.
      </p>

      <p>
        We must kindly stress however, that although we may be able to help
        locate an item in an emergency, not all of our buses are operated by the
        same drivers throughout the day, and we may not be able to find
        misplaced items until it is handed in the next day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, we encourage all of our passengers to double check when
        leaving the bus for any personal items that could be left behind.
      </p>
