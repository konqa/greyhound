      <h1 class="page-heading">About us</h1>

      <p>
        Since 1984 we’ve brought you South Africa’s favourite luxury coach
        solution, connecting cities as old the country itself and towns as
        brilliantly curious as the cultures that connect us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, every year we transport 804 293 passengers over 25 million km of
        road, traveling across a comprehensive network of Southern African tar.
        So, whether you’re looking for a luxury bus from Johannesburg to Cape
        Town, from Durban to Pretoria, we have you covered; yes, from the Cape
        to Harare, from the Natal to Maputo, from the hills of the Transkei to
        the golden fields of the Free State (via most villages, dorpies and
        towns) we have you luxuriously covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without doubt, there’s a reason we’re South Africa’s favourite. When
        luxury yearns for affordability, our liners shine the brightest: We are
        the most luxurious bussing solution this side of equator, available with
        Dreamliners built to 5-star specifications and an experience defined by
        professionalism, punctuality and good ol’ fashioned politeness.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the leading solution for luxury bus bookings in South Africa, the
        question is, where can Greyhound take you?
